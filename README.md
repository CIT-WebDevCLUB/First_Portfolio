# Web Dev Club - Collaborative Learning Project

Welcome to the official repository for our college's Web Dev Club! This project is designed to be a collaborative space where members can learn the fundamentals of web development and contribute to a real-world project.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to build a comprehensive portfolio website for the club, showcasing the skills and projects of our members. This will be an ongoing project that will evolve as our members learn and contribute.

## Learning Path

This repository is a learning tool. We encourage all members, especially beginners, to follow this path:

1.  **Fork this repository:** Create your own copy of the project to work on.
2.  **Clone your fork:** Download your forked repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/First_Portfolio.git
    ```
3.  **Explore the code:** Start by examining the [`index.html`](main/index.html:1), [`style.css`](main/style.css:1), and [`script.js`](main/script.js:1) files.
4.  **Make small changes:** Experiment by changing text, colors, or adding new HTML elements.
5.  **Follow the tutorials:** We will be providing tutorials and workshops to help you learn the necessary skills.
6.  **Ask questions:** Don't hesitate to ask questions in our club's communication channels.

## How to Contribute

Once you feel comfortable with the basics, you can start contributing to the main project. Here's how:

1.  **Find an issue:** Check the "Issues" tab for tasks that need to be done.
2.  **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes. A good branch name would be descriptive of the changes you are making (e.g., `add-navbar-feature`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
3.  **Commit your changes:** Make your changes and commit them with a clear message. First, stage your changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    Then, commit them:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
    ```
4.  **Push to your fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
5.  **Create a pull request:** Open a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.
